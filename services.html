<p style="width: 800px; margin-left: 300px; ">From the beginning, one of our goals has been to create volume and fullness while promoting healthy growth of the natural hair. We created our custom installation methods, a traditional hand-tied method and our no-show method, to eliminate the use of heat, chemicals, and glue. Instead, our extensions use gentle beads that wrap around the head to keep the tension of the wefts consistent. This ensures that the natural hair is never over-directed or plucked, which would cause breakage or damage.

  Each method allows the stylist to give each client exactly what they desire for fullness and volume while maintaining the best integrity of their natural hair. Extension placement can be altered for each client depending on their hair type and how they prefer to part and style their hair.</p>

Ideal for both our Narrow Edge and Luxury Line extensions, the stylist is able to make the rows as thick or as thin as the client desires.</p>
